# Magic The Gathering stuff

I designed a 60x35 (23.6"x13.7") placemat for playing Magic The Gathering.
It has a place for your library, graveyard, commander, commander tax, exile, land cards and battlefield. It also has a (currently) misc field top right for whatever you want to put there.

The placemat is designed to allow for you to put whatever background you'd like.
